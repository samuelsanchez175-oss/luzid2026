# User Communication Markers

When communicating with the user, use these markers consistently:

## Action Required / Failures

When something requires the user's action, or when explaining why a build or prompt failed:

- Use **⚠️** (hazard/warning) or **🛑** (stop sign) at the start of the line
- Place it next to any instruction the user must perform
- Include a brief reason when relevant

**Example:**
> ⚠️ **Action required:** Compress the video to under 100MB before pushing, or GitHub will reject the deployment.

**Example:**
> 🛑 **Build failed:** File exceeds GitHub's 100MB limit. Compress `tyga-hello-bitch.mov` and try again.

## Completed Tasks

When a task or instruction has been completed successfully:

- Use **✅** (green checkmark) at the start of the line
- Use for: finished edits, successful pushes, completed deployments, resolved issues

**Example:**
> ✅ Changes committed and pushed to GitHub. Vercel will deploy within 1–2 minutes.

**Example:**
> ✅ Updated the Hello Bitch card to use the Tyga video.
