# Auto Commit & Push

After completing any task that modifies files in this project, always run:

```bash
git add -A && git status
```

If there are changes to commit:

```bash
git commit -m "<descriptive message>" && git push
```

Do not skip this step. The user expects changes to be committed and pushed after every prompt.
